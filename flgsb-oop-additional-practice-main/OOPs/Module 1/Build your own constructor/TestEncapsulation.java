        // and see if your validation works
        
        // Step 4: Give both employees a 10% raise and display their details again
        
        // Step 5: Clone the first employee and display the cloned employee details
        // Hint: Use try-catch block to handle CloneNotSupportedException

        // and returns the name of the employee with the higher salary
