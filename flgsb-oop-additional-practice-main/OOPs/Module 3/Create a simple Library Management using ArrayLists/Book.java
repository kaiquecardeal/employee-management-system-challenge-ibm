// Book class to represent a library book
public class Book {
    // Step 1: Declare private variables for bookTitle, author, publicationYear, and isAvailable
    // Hint: Use appropriate data types (String for title/author, int for year, boolean for availability)
    
    // Step 2: Create a constructor that accepts bookTitle, author, and publicationYear
    // Hint: Initialize all fields including setting isAvailable to true by default
    
    // Step 3: Create public getter methods for each variable
    // Hint: Use the format: public returnType getVariableName()
    
    // Step 4: Create public setter methods for relevant variables
    // Hint: You might not need setters for all variables
    
    // Step 5: Create methods to check out and return a book
    // checkOut() method should set isAvailable to false and return true if the book was available
    // returnBook() method should set isAvailable to true and return true if the book was checked out
    
    // Step 6: Override toString() method to display book details
    // Hint: Show title, author, year, and availability status
